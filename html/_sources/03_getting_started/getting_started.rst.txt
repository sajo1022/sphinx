GitLab
================

------

In order to download and participate in the project, it is necessary to use GitLab.
To clone the project repository, call the following command in your desired local directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://www.w.hs-karlsruhe.de/gitlab/iras/research-projects/maurob40/image_processing.git

Remember to checkout a new branch when working on this project:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout -b {BRANCHNAME}

It is recommended to create a merge request when the work on a branch is completed.
Additional information on how to use Gitlab can be found in the :ref:`official GitLab documentation <gitLab-documentation>`.

Prerequisites
================

.. _pipenv-:


Setup Halcon
------------

The project utilises Mvtec-Halcon as the main software for the required imageprocessing methods. In order to use these methods
in a python script, it is necessary to install Halcon first.
Go to https://www.mvtec.com/downloads to download Halcon 21.05 and install it.

When working on Linux, the following environment variables must be set:

::

    • HALCONROOT: directory you installed HALCON in.
    • HALCONEXAMPLES: directory the example programs are installed in ($HALCONROOT/examples).
    • HALCONIMAGES: directory the example images are installed in ($HALCONEXAMPLES/images).
    • HALCONARCH: select value corresponding to the used platform.
    • PATH: this system variable should include $HALCONROOT/bin/$HALCONARCH.
    • LD_LIBRARY_PATH: this system variable should include $HALCONROOT/lib/$HALCONARCH.

This is an abstract from the official :ref:`installation guide <halcon-installation>`. Please visit this guide for a further,
more detailed description on how to install and setup Halcon.

In order to license Halcon, it is necessary to install the license management software :ref:`CodeMeter <codemeter-download>`.
Go to https://license.mvtec.com/campus/ to activate your personal 25 digit student ticket. During this process you can
choose to activate Halcon using the CodeMeter API. This should automatically create a ``MVTec SW Container`` in your local
CodeMeter control center. If that is the case, Halcon was successfully activated.
If you need further information, visit the :ref:`Halcon installation guide <halcon-installation>`.

Setup Arena SDK
---------------

Arena SDK is the official software for the 3D ToF camera ``Helios2``, which is currently used in this project.
In order to communicate with this camera via ethernet, it is necessary to install the
:ref:`Arena SDK software package <arenaSDK-download>`. Make sure to download the suitable version for your operating
system and install it.

Docker
------

Since this image processing procedure needs to run in a Docker container when properly used in the "MauRob40" later on,
it is necessary to install the Docker engine on your local machine.
If you install the Docker Engine for the first time, it is required to set up the Docker repository first.
To do this type:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
    $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    $ echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

To now install the latest version of the Docker Engine type:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

.. hint::

    If you want to install a specific version of the Docker Engine, go to the official
    :ref:`Docker installation guide<docker-installation>` to find a list of the available versions.

To check whether the installation was successful type:

.. code-block::

    $ sudo docker run hello-world
