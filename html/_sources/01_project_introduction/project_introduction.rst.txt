Welcome to the introduction of the project "MauRob40".
In this chapter of the documentation a general overview of the entire project will be given.

In addition to the general overview, the project goal in respect to the
image processing for stone localization as well as its framework requirements
will be covered under :ref:`Image processing goal<image-processing-goal>`.

Project description
======================

------

The goal of the project "MauRob40", is the development of a concept and the prototyping of a masonry robot for
increasing efficiency and supplementing human labor force on construction sites.
The project team, consisting of Dreßler Bau GmbH, AAT Automation GmbH and Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences,
is responsible for the development of this concept with rough and
detailed planning in the first phase of the project. In addition, practical preliminary tests for the realization
of a masonry robot are to be performed.
The concept is to be realized by means of existing industrial robot systems as well as components
available on the market.

.. _image-processing-goal:

Image processing goal
===========================

------

The most general goal for the image processing part of the project is to localize stones, so they can automatically be picked by a robot.

To better understand the challenges coming with this supposedly simple task, the projects framework
requirements will be described in the following paragraph.


Framework requirements
========================

------

This section gives a summary of points, that have to be taken into account in the development process for location stones under the harsh conditions of a construction site.

.. _environmental-conditions:

Environmental conditions
-------------------------
Since image processing usually is highly sensitive to its surroundings, developing a procedure that performs well under highly dynamic environmental conditions can be challenging. The following table provides an overview of the most
important interfering factors given the projects conditions and the requirements that can be derived from it.

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 70 100 125


    Factor , Conditions , Requirements
    Humidity , fog; light rain; snow, at least IPX4
    Air pollution, e.g. dust, at least IP6X
    Vibration, e.g due to drilling, vibration resistance DIN EN 60068-2-64:2020-091
    Temperature, approx. 0-40°C, cold and heat resistance in the given temperature range and beyond. Direct exposure to sunlight can significantly increase the effective temperature resistance can be significantly higher.
    Lighting, dusk; midday; dawn, functional at illumination levels from 80 - 100k Lux
    Light spectrum, sun light; cloudy, interference stable in the spectral range of sunlight


Stone types
--------------
The types of stones to be localized can be divided into **two groups**. There are **standardized stones**,
later also called **standard stones**, which have standardized geometry. Standard stones are used in most cases.

The second type of stones that have to be localized are called **fitting stones**.
They are only used in case no standardized stone in the correct format is available.
This can happen at dominant points of the wall like windows or door frames.

Quadro stones
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The so called standard stones are actually stones of the type KS-Quadro. They are available in four different formats (1/1; 3/4; 1/2; 1/4)
and in a variety of widths (115mm; 150mm; 175mm...). A comprehensive overview can be found at https://www.ks-quadro.de/de/ks-quadro-system/ks-quadro.

    (*source:* https://www.ks-quadro.de/de/ks-quadro-system/ks-quadro)

KS-Quadro stones have two holes on top with exception of the small KS-Quadro 1/4 which sometimes only has one.
These holes will later be used to localize standard stones.
Standard stones are always delivered unmixed, which means that on one pallet of standard stones is always only one format with the same width.
The stones can be delivered in multiple layers on the pallet.

Fitting stones
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In contrary to the standardized KS-Quadro stones, the fitting stones can be found in every size.
**Fitting stones** are individually cut and automatically palletized at the stone manufacturer.
Due to the fact that this process is fully automated, a stones position and its geometry is known and can be accessed via a xml-file.

Fitting stones are delivered on mixed pallets while only stones used in one wall are on one pallet.
Multiple pallets per wall are possible. Fitting stone pallets always have one layer of stones.
The image below shows the top down view of an example pallet of fitting stones.

So what are the requirements for the image processing?
-------------------------------------------------------
The image processing in regard to stone localization must be able to correctly localize both standard stones as well as fitting stones
and provide the robot with the localized stones x-, y- and z-coordinate in respect to some defined origin.
In addition, the stones orientation must be found so it can be picked by the robot.
For standard stones some method has to be found to identify the top layer of stones on a pallet.
All this must be performed on a robust basis under the highly dynamic conditions of a construction site as mentioned in :ref:`Environmental conditions <environmental-conditions>`


The following part will focus on some image processing basics and how to perform different operations used in this project.
