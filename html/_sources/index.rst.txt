Image Processing for the project "MauRob40"
============================================
Welcome to the documentation of the image processing for stone localization in the context of the development of the project "MauRob40".

The main focus of this documentation is to give an overview of the image processing procedures
for locating various stone types. Also the framework of the image processing and the general
project structure and used tools will be described. This documentation is ment to provide
users and developers with the required background information to utilize the developed
application and contribute to it.
